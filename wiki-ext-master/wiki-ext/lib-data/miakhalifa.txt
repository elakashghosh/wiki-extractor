Mia Khalifa (Arabic: ميا خليفة‎‎; born February 10, 1993), also known as Mia Callista, is a Lebanese American social media personality and webcam model, best known for her successful, albeit brief, career as a pornographic actress from 2014 to 2015.
Born in Beirut, Khalifa moved to the United States in 2000. She began acting in pornography in October 2014, and by December was ranked the number 1 performer on the website Pornhub. Her career choice was met with controversy in the Middle East, especially for a video in which she performed sexual acts while wearing the Islamic hijab. She was nevertheless disillusioned with the pornographic industry and left it after three months.
